## 💡 Key Insights

### What Worked Well ✅
1. **Modular Architecture**: Easy to add routing logic without breaking existing code
2. **Type Safety**: TypeScript caught many potential bugs
3. **Reusable Components**: NotificationCenter works for all roles
4. **Clear Data Flow**: Easy to follow from exam → routing → checkout
5. **Visual Feedback**: Color-coded alerts make urgency obvious

### Challenges Overcome 🎯
1. **Complex Routing Logic**: Solved with clear prioritization rules
2. **Role Mapping**: Handled with type-safe mapping function
3. **Notification State**: Managed with React state and local mock data
4. **UI Consistency**: Used existing design system components

### Design Decisions 🤔
1. **Alert Placement**: In-page alert (not modal) for better UX
2. **Notification Panel**: Floating panel (not full page) for quick access
3. **Priority Sorting**: Automatic sorting by urgency + time
4. **Archive Section**: Keep completed items for reference
