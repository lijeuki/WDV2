# Redesigned Dental EHR Workflow: Examination & Treatment Plan Execution

**Document Version:** 2.0 (Rethink: Exam-Only to Integrated Exam+Treatment)  
**Status:** Analysis & Architecture Recommendation  
**Date:** 2025-10-24

---

## Executive Summary

The current EHR workflow is **linear and exam-centric**. Real dental practice is **non-linear and treatment-centric**. This document proposes a **state-machine architecture** that:

- ✅ Supports immediate same-day treatment after examination
- ✅ Handles delayed/scheduled treatment from approved plans
- ✅ Captures pre-treatment clinical decisions (anesthesia, consent, prep)
- ✅ Documents actual procedural execution vs. planned care
- ✅ Generates accurate billing codes for both exams and treatments
- ✅ Maintains full audit trail and clinical compliance

## Part 1: Current Flow (Exam-Only) — Limitations

### The 6-Step Linear Flow (As-Is)

```
Step 1: Pre-Exam Review
    ↓
Step 2: Clinical Examination
    ↓
Step 3: Treatment Plan Development
    ↓
Step 4: SOAP Notes
    ↓
Step 5: Prescriptions
    ↓
Step 6: Complete Examination
    ↓
[VISIT ENDS]
```

**Why This Fails:**

| Scenario | Current System | Real-World Problem |
|----------|---|---|
| Patient says "Fix this tooth now" | No option to proceed | Doctor must schedule return visit; loses revenue & patient satisfaction |
| Anesthesia required | No field in current flow | Dentist uses paper or memory; compliance gap |
| Doctor uses different filling material than planned | No way to record change | Billing and clinical record mismatch |
| Treatment encounters complication | Not captured in plan-based system | Root cause analysis impossible; liability risk |
| Treatment takes 2 hours vs. planned 45 min | Plan doesn't reflect reality | Operatory scheduling becomes inaccurate |

## Part 5: Real-World Scenarios & System Responses

### Scenario 1: Exam + Immediate Treatment (Same-Day)

**Patient:** New patient, presents with pain in #36

```
SYSTEM WORKFLOW:
1. Reception: Check-in & verify insurance ✓
2. Clinical: Pre-exam review (allergies, medical history) ✓
3. Doctor: Examination performed; finds cavity
4. Doctor: Creates treatment plan (Composite filling)
5. Doctor: Shows patient odontogram & plan costs
6. DECISION: Patient says "Just fix it now!"
7. SYSTEM PROMPT: "Treatment Authorization Form"
   - Patient e-signs consent
   - Insurance pre-auth checked ✓ APPROVED
8. SYSTEM: Operatory assigned, RDA prepped chair
9. Doctor: Enters anesthesia data
   - Type: Local (1% Lidocaine)
   - Site: Buccal infiltration
   - Dose: 40mg
   - Injection time: 10:30 AM
10. Doctor: Real-time procedural notes during filling
    - Removed caries
    - Placed composite in 3 layers
    - Polished and tested occlusion
11. Doctor: Enters post-op instructions
    - "No eating for 2 hours"
    - "Ibuprofen if sore"
12. Doctor: Generates CPT codes (Exam + Filling)
13. Billing: Charges insurance ($250 total, $50 pt responsibility)
14. Patient: Leaves with post-op slip

TOTAL TIME: 90 minutes (all in one visit)
BILLING ACCURACY: 100% (codes reflect actual treatment done)
```

---

### Scenario 2: Exam + Plan + Scheduled Treatment (Multi-Visit)

**Patient:** Existing patient, annual exam + discovers need for crown

```
SYSTEM WORKFLOW:
1. Doctor: Performs examination
   - Finds old cracked crown on #14
   - Creates treatment plan: Crown replacement
2. DECISION: Patient says "I need to check my schedule"
3. SYSTEM: Plan moves to APPROVED_SCHEDULED state
4. Front Desk: Schedules treatment appointment
   - Date: 2 weeks from now
   - Duration: 90 minutes (crown appointment)
   - Notes: "Prep old crown, prepare tooth, place temp crown"
5. Patient leaves (exam complete)
6. [2 WEEKS LATER] Patient returns for scheduled appointment
7. Doctor: Recalls treatment plan from system
8. Doctor: Enters anesthesia data (same as before)
9. Doctor: Performs crown prep
   - Real-time notes: "Removed old crown. Prepared tooth. Placed temporary."
10. Doctor: Takes impression (or digital scan)
11. SYSTEM: Auto-generates crown order for lab
12. Doctor: Post-op instructions for temp crown
13. [1 WEEK LATER] Crown returns from lab
14. Patient: Scheduled for try-in & cementation
15. Doctor: Enters anesthesia, tries in, cements crown
16. All procedural data captured in same treatment plan item

BILLING ACCURACY: Separate billing for prep visit vs. cementation visit
```

---

### Scenario 3: Exam + Plan + Complications

**Patient:** Exam, decides on treatment, but complication during procedure

```
SYSTEM WORKFLOW:
1. Doctor: Performs exam, creates plan for endodontic (root canal)
2. Patient: Approves immediate treatment (APPROVED_IMMEDIATE)
3. Doctor: Enters anesthesia
4. Doctor: Begins treatment
5. [DURING PROCEDURE]: Instrument fractures inside canal
6. Doctor: SYSTEM ALERT for "Complication Encountered"
7. Doctor: Selects "Instrument fracture" and documents action
8. Doctor: Decides to refer patient to endodontist
9. Doctor: Updates treatment status to "INCOMPLETE - REFERRAL"
10. SYSTEM: Generates referral note with all clinical data
11. Doctor: Schedules referral appointment with specialist
12. Billing: Adjusts charges (partial treatment charge only)
13. Notes in chart: "Complication: instrument fracture. Referred to Dr. Specialist for completion."

COMPLIANCE: Full audit trail of what went wrong + action taken
LIABILITY PROTECTION: Complication properly documented
```

## Conclusion

The current linear exam-only workflow does not reflect real dental practice. This redesign transforms the EHR from a **passive documentation tool** into an **active treatment management system** that:
