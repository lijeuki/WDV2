# 📅 Week 3: Treatment Plan → Scheduling Integration - COMPLETE

**Date**: October 24, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**  
**Time Invested**: ~2 hours

---

## ✅ What Was Completed

### 1. Intelligent Procedure Grouping System
**File**: `src/lib/scheduling/procedure-grouping.ts` (350+ lines)

#### Core Features Implemented ✅

**Automatic Visit Grouping:**
- ✅ Groups treatment procedures into logical visits
- ✅ Respects clinical sequencing rules
- ✅ Considers time and complexity constraints
- ✅ Identifies procedure dependencies

**Clinical Sequencing Rules:**
```typescript
✅ Root canal MUST come before crown (same tooth)
✅ Extraction MUST come before implant
✅ Cleaning/Periodontal SHOULD come before restorative
✅ Emergency procedures get their own visit (priority)
```

**Grouping Constraints:**
```typescript
✅ Max 180 minutes (3 hours) per visit
✅ Max 4 procedures per visit
✅ Quadrant awareness (optional)
✅ Adjacent teeth preference
```

**Procedure Categories:**
```typescript
✅ Emergency (highest priority)
✅ Extraction
✅ Root Canal
✅ Crown
✅ Implant
✅ Cleaning/Periodontal
✅ Filling/Restorative
✅ Other
```

**Healing Time Calculation:**
```typescript
✅ Extraction → Implant: 90 days (3 months)
✅ Root Canal → Crown: 7 days (1 week)
✅ Periodontal → Filling: 7 days (1 week)
✅ Emergency → Follow-up: 2 days
✅ Default between visits: 7 days
```

**Visit Validation:**
- ✅ Check if all dependencies are met
- ✅ Verify prior visits are scheduled
- ✅ Suggest optimal appointment dates
- ✅ Block scheduling if prerequisites not met

#### Intelligent Features ✅

**1. Complexity Score:**
```
Factors considered:
- Number of procedures (>3 = +2 points)
- Total cost (>10M IDR = +3 points)
- Urgent findings (+2 points)
- High-value procedures (+2 points)

Score determines treatment complexity level
```

**2. Auto-Generated Visit Notes:**
```
Examples:
⚠️ Emergency treatment
🦷 Cleaning before restorative work
🔧 Root canal - crown in subsequent visit
🦷 Extraction - healing required
🔩 Implant - integration period
📍 Multiple teeth: 16, 17, 18
```

**3. Dependency Tracking:**
```typescript
Visit 1: Root canal tooth #36
Visit 2: Crown tooth #36 (requires Visit 1)
Visit 3: Cleaning all quadrants (independent)

System blocks Visit 2 until Visit 1 is complete
```

---

### 2. Treatment Plan Scheduler Component
**File**: `src/components/organisms/TreatmentPlanScheduler.tsx` (420+ lines)

#### Visual Features ✅

**Progress Tracking:**
- ✅ Visual progress bar (scheduled/total visits)
- ✅ Visit numbering with status indicators
- ✅ Color-coded visit cards:
  - 🔴 Gray: Not yet schedulable (dependencies)
  - 🔵 Blue: Ready to schedule
  - 🟢 Green: Scheduled

**Visit Cards Display:**
```
┌────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🟢 Visit 1 - Scheduled                 │
│                                         │
│ 🦷 Cleaning/Periodontal treatment      │
│ └─ #16 Prophylaxis (45min)            │

│                                         │
│ [Reschedule]                           │
└────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Scheduling Interface:**
- ✅ Date picker with suggested dates
- ✅ Time picker
- ✅ Duration display
- ✅ Save/Cancel buttons
- ✅ Reschedule functionality

**Dependency Warnings:**
```
⚠️ Schedule previous visit first
Visit 2 requires Visit 1 to be completed

[Blocked - Not Schedulable]
```

**Sequencing Notes:**
```
ℹ️ Treatment Sequence
Visits are ordered based on clinical requirements.
Some procedures require healing time before
subsequent treatments can begin.
```

#### Interactive Features ✅
