# Business Process Integration Architecture
## From Clinical Data to Practice Growth

> **"The Clinical Exam is the engine. Business processes are the drivetrain, wheels, and steering that translate clinical data into better care and profitability."**

---

## 🎯 The Core Question

**"Now that I've entered this clinical data, what happens next?"**

When a dentist completes an exam and charts findings:
1. **Who needs to see it?** → Treatment Coordinator, Front Desk, Patient, Insurance
2. **What systems does it trigger?** → Scheduling, Billing, Insurance, Communication, Analytics
3. **How does it help care?** → Follow-up reminders, treatment tracking, outcome monitoring
4. **How does it help business?** → Revenue tracking, conversion rates, resource planning

## 💡 The Complete Vision

```
CLINICAL DATA (Engine)
        ↓
BUSINESS PROCESSES (Drivetrain)
        ↓
PATIENT OUTCOMES + PRACTICE GROWTH (Forward Motion)
```

**This is the difference between:**
- ❌ An EHR that's a glorified filing cabinet
- ✅ An EHR that's a practice growth engine

**Every piece of clinical data should answer:**
1. **What's next?** (Workflow routing)
2. **Who's responsible?** (Task assignment)
3. **When does it happen?** (Automation triggers)
4. **How do we measure success?** (Analytics)

---

**Next Steps**: Prioritize which business process integrations to build first based on practice needs and ROI.
