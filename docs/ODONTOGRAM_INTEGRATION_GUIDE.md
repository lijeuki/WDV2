# Interactive Odontogram Integration in Clinical Exam Workflow

## Overview
The Interactive Odontogram has been successfully integrated into the Clinical Examination Workflow, replacing the simplified dental chart with a full-featured, ISO/FDI-compliant charting system.

## What Changed

### 1. **Component Replacement**
- **Before**: `SimplifiedDentalChart` - basic tooth selection with procedure dialog
- **After**: `InteractiveOdontogram` + `SymbolPalette` - comprehensive surface-level charting with standardized dental symbols

### 2. **New Imports**
```typescript
import { InteractiveOdontogram } from "../organisms/InteractiveOdontogram";
import { SymbolPalette } from "../molecules/SymbolPalette";
import { DentalSymbol, ToothData, DENTAL_SYMBOLS } from "../../lib/odontogram-types";
```

### 3. **State Management**
Added two new state variables to track odontogram data:
```typescript
const [selectedSymbol, setSelectedSymbol] = useState<DentalSymbol | null>(null);
const [odontogramData, setOdontogramData] = useState<Record<string, ToothData>>({});
```

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Smart Findings-to-Procedure Conversion**
The system automatically suggests treatment procedures based on charted dental findings:

| Dental Finding | Suggested Procedure | Priority |
|---------------|-------------------|----------|
| Caries (Cavity) | Tambalan Komposit | Medium-High |
| Fractured Tooth | Mahkota Keramik | High |
| Missing Tooth | Implan Gigi | Low |
| Non-Vital Tooth | Perawatan Saluran Akar | High |
| Tooth Wear | Mahkota Keramik | Low |
| Retained Root | Pencabutan Gigi | Medium |

**Note**: Existing restorations (composite fillings, crowns, implants, etc.) are recognized but don't trigger new procedure suggestions since they're already treated.

### 2. **Layout Structure**
The examination step now uses a 3-column grid layout:
- **Left (2/3 width)**: Interactive Odontogram with 4-quadrant FDI notation
- **Right (1/3 width)**: Symbol Palette with searchable symbols and categories

### 3. **Workflow Integration**
```
Step 1: Select Symbol → Step 2: Chart Finding → Step 3: Auto-Suggest Procedure → Step 4: Review & Modify
```

## How It Works

### For Dentists/Clinicians:

1. **Start Examination** (Step 2: Clinical Examination)
   - Interactive odontogram displays with all 32 adult teeth in FDI notation
   - Symbol palette shows all available dental symbols organized by category

2. **Chart Findings**
   - Select a symbol from the palette (e.g., "Caries", "Fractured", "Missing")
   - Click on specific tooth surfaces (O, M, D, B, L) to record the finding
   - Add clinical notes to individual teeth for detailed documentation

3. **Auto-Generated Treatment Plan**
   - System analyzes charted findings
   - Automatically suggests appropriate procedures
   - Procedures appear in "Prosedur yang Disarankan" card with:
     - Tooth number
     - Finding description
     - Affected surfaces
     - Priority level (High/Medium/Low)
     - Estimated cost and duration

4. **Review & Modify** (Step 3: Treatment Plan Management)
   - All suggested procedures appear in treatment plan
   - Modify priority, status, or notes as needed
   - Add manual procedures if needed
   - Review pending procedures from previous visits

## Conversion Logic

The `convertOdontogramToProcedures()` function:

1. **Monitors odontogram changes** via `handleOdontogramDataChange()`
2. **Analyzes each tooth condition** recorded in the odontogram
3. **Maps dental symbols to treatment procedures** using predefined rules
4. **Prevents duplicates** by checking if procedure already exists
5. **Auto-populates procedure details**:
   - Tooth number and surfaces from charting
   - Procedure name, cost, and duration from library
   - Clinical notes from odontogram
   - Priority based on severity

## Benefits

### 1. **Standardization**
- ISO 3950 / FDI compliant symbols
- Consistent dental terminology (Indonesian)
- Standardized notation across all records

### 2. **Efficiency**
- No manual procedure entry for common findings
- Surface-level precision in charting
- One-click charting with auto-populated treatments

### 3. **Documentation Quality**
- Visual odontogram record
- Detailed surface-level findings
- Clinical notes linked to specific teeth
- Complete audit trail

### 4. **Patient Care**
- Comprehensive examination records
- Clear treatment recommendations
- Easy before/after comparison
- Evidence-based treatment planning

- [ ] Treatment progress tracking on odontogram

## Technical Details

### Component Props
```typescript
<InteractiveOdontogram
  patientId={patientId}           // Patient identifier
  initialData={odontogramData}    // Pre-existing charting data
  dentitionType="adult"           // Adult or pediatric
  readOnly={false}                // Editable during exam
  onDataChange={handleOdontogramDataChange}  // Callback when charting changes
  selectedSymbol={selectedSymbol}  // Active symbol from palette
/>

<SymbolPalette
  onSymbolSelect={handleSymbolSelect}     // Callback when symbol selected
  selectedSymbolId={selectedSymbol?.id}   // Highlight active symbol
/>
```

### Data Structure
```typescript
// Tooth data stored in odontogramData state
{
  "16": {  // FDI tooth number
    toothNumber: "16",
    conditions: [
      {
        symbolId: "caries",
        surfaces: ["occlusal", "mesial"],
        severity: "moderate",
        dateRecorded: Date,
        recordedBy: "Dr. Name",
        notes: "Deep cavity requiring restoration"
      }
    ],
    clinicalNotes: "Additional observations...",
    images: [],
    mobility: undefined,
    bleeding: false
  }
}
```
