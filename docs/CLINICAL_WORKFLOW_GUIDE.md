# Clinical Examination Workflow Guide

## Overview

The Clinical Examination Workflow is designed specifically for dentists and dental professionals to streamline the patient examination process. This guided workflow ensures complete and accurate documentation while maintaining focus on patient care.

---

## üè• Workflow Philosophy

### Doctor-Centric Design
- **Focus on Clinical Care**: Streamlined interface for examination and documentation
- **Step-by-Step Guidance**: Progressive disclosure prevents information overload
- **Auto-Save Features**: Minimize data loss with draft saving
- **Context Preservation**: Patient information always visible

### Separation of Concerns
- **Doctor Dashboard**: Clinical examinations, treatment planning, patient care
- **Front Desk Dashboard**: Scheduling, check-in/out, billing (to be implemented)
- **Clear Role Boundaries**: Each role sees only relevant features

---

## üìã Examination Workflow Steps

### Step 1: Pre-Examination Review

**Purpose**: Review patient information before starting clinical work

**Components:**
- **Medical Alerts**: Prominently displayed allergies and conditions
- **Patient Information**: Demographics, blood type, contact details
- **Medical History**: Current conditions, medications, allergies
- **Previous Dental History**: Read-only past treatment records
- **Chief Complaint**: Document reason for today's visit

**Key Features:**
```
‚úì Allergy alerts highlighted in amber
‚úì Medical history auto-loaded
‚úì Previous treatments displayed chronologically
‚úì Chief complaint text entry
```

**Clinical Checklist:**
- [ ] Review medical alerts
- [ ] Check current medications
- [ ] Verify allergy information
- [ ] Review previous dental treatments
- [ ] Document chief complaint

---

### Step 2: Clinical Examination

**Purpose**: Perform physical examination and record findings

**Components:**
- **Enhanced Dental Chart**: Interactive FDI notation odontogram
- **Surface-Based Recording**: Document specific tooth surfaces
- **Clinical Findings**: Text notes for observations
- **Photo/X-ray Integration**: (Future enhancement)

**Enhanced Dental Chart Features:**
```
‚úì FDI (ISO 3950) two-digit notation
‚úì Click teeth to record conditions
‚úì Surface-level recording (MODBL)
‚úì Visual tooth status indicators
‚úì Condition history tracking
```

**Recording Process:**
1. Click on affected tooth in odontogram
2. Select condition (cavity, filling, crown, etc.)
3. Click specific surfaces affected
4. Add clinical notes
5. System auto-saves findings

**Common Findings:**
- Caries (cavities) with surface detail
- Existing restorations (fillings, crowns)
- Missing teeth
- Root canal treatments
- Periodontal conditions
- Fractures or damage

---

### Step 3: Treatment Plan Development

**Purpose**: Create treatment recommendations based on findings

**Components:**
- **Auto-Generated Recommendations**: Based on dental chart findings
- **Priority Levels**: High, Medium, Low
- **Cost Estimates**: Duration and fee estimates
- **Treatment Notes**: Additional details and alternatives

**Treatment Plan Items:**
```
For each finding from examination:
- Tooth number (FDI notation)
- Recommended treatment
- Priority level
- Estimated duration
- Estimated cost
- Clinical notes
```

**Example:**
```
Tooth #36 (Lower Left First Molar)
‚îú‚îÄ Condition: Cavity on Occlusal, Mesial surfaces
‚îú‚îÄ Treatment: Composite filling
‚îú‚îÄ Priority: High
‚îú‚îÄ Duration: 45 minutes
‚îú‚îÄ Cost: $250
‚îî‚îÄ Notes: Patient prefers tooth-colored restoration
```

**Treatment Categories:**
- **Preventive**: Cleanings, fluoride, sealants
- **Restorative**: Fillings, crowns, bridges
- **Endodontic**: Root canals
- **Periodontal**: Gum treatments, scaling
- **Prosthodontic**: Dentures, implants
- **Oral Surgery**: Extractions, surgical procedures

---

### Step 4: SOAP Notes

K02.52 - Dental caries on smooth surface
K04.7  - Periapical abscess without sinus
K05.6  - Periodontal disease, unspecified
K08.1  - Loss of teeth due to accident, extraction, or local disease
K08.3  - Retained dental root
```

#### **P - Plan**
Treatment and follow-up:
- Recommended treatments
- Patient education provided
- Preventive care instructions
- Follow-up schedule
- Referrals if needed

**Documentation Best Practices:**
